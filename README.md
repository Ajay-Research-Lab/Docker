# Docker
This repository provides the docker files and the links to docker images from dockerHub. These docker images have been created for usage of the lab members to develop numerical methods and enhance reproducibility of the developed methods. We are always interested to help you if you would like to use our software or reproduce the results from our paper. 

Each of the docker images are documented in the particular folders. Currently, we have docker images for C++ and Python. These docker images are based on Ubuntu base OS. We aim to add more images in the future. If there is something of interest, please feel free to contact us. 

For more information about our research, please feel free to check our website www.ajaylab.co.uk. If you would like help and would like to use our images, please feel free to reachout to us at ajay.harish@manchester.ac.uk.
